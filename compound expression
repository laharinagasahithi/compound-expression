A compound expression is a series of simple expressions joined by arithmetic operators.
A simple expression used in a compound expression must return a numeric value.

example:
('SMITH' || 'JONES')
sum(x) / y
sqrt(256) * avg(column)
rank() over (order by qtysold) / 100
(select (pricepaid - commission) from sales where dateid = 1882) * (qtysold)
